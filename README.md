The project, developed using Java SDK 17 Corretto, aims to determine the continent and country associated with a specific IPv4 address by parsing .csv files obtained from MaxMind.com. These files contain a mapping of network addresses to their respective locations. The program employs the binary search algorithm to efficiently find the country and continent that have registered the given IP address.
